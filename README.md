### How we can use this application

<b>Introduction</b>

Clean YouTube is a platform designed for users who want to learn from YouTube without any distractions. This app allows users to watch playlists without being interrupted by suggested videos or other distractions. Clean YouTube has four main sections: Home, Playlists, Favorite, and Recent. In this documentation, we'll describe each section in detail.

<b>Home Page</b>

The Home page displays the latest playlists added to Clean YouTube. Users can click on a playlist to go to the playlist page. Each playlist shows the playlist's name, thumbnail, and the number of videos in it.

<b>Playlists Page</b>

The Playlists page shows up to six playlists. Users can also add their own playlists by providing a playlist ID or URL. Each playlist on this page shows the playlist's name, thumbnail, and the number of videos in it. Users can click on a playlist to go to the playlist player.

<b>Favorite Page</b>

The Favorite page allows users to save playlists they like. Users can add or remove playlists from their Favorites list by clicking on the heart icon next to the playlist.

The Recent page shows the playlists the user recently watched. Users can click on a playlist to go to the playlist player.

<b>Playlist Player</b>

The Playlist Player is a single player that allows users to watch a playlist without any distractions. The player has three sections: the video player, the playlist navigation, and the notes section.

The notes section allows the user to take notes while watching the playlist.
